The Reef-World team was recently asked to summarise why we care about coral reefs to support [ICRI](https://www.icriforum.org/) ’s recommendation that [coral reefs must be prioritised](https://greenfins.net/blog/coral-reef-importance/) in the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).

Here is my answer:

> _“Visiting coral reefs is to visit life: to see the building blocks of the ocean. As a freediver, I love the diversity of colours and structures of coral reefs – a sanctuary for abundant and unique marine life – but also because corals exist in a place free from distractions that we can only visit fleetingly and in the moment. I love the simplicity of taking a single breath and spending a few minutes in a world that is so different and yet so intrinsically linked to our own.”_
