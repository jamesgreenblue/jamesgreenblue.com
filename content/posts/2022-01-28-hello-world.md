Writing the first post for a new blog is, to me, a lot like starting a fresh notebook, or buying a new piece of diving equipment. There is trepidation about getting started mixed with excitement about what will come from it.

At some point you have to stop worrying about it and just start somewhere. So lets go!

(This is my third attempt, so to give myself a head start I have collated a few posts written for other sites.)
