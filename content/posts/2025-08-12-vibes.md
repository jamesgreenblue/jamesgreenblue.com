With a little prompting, Gemini generated a working Tampermonkey script as documented in [Identify your users by name in Amplitude](/blog/2025/name-users-in-amplitude/). 

To conclude the conversation I asked, _"How can I credit you as an author?"_

{{< quote source="Google Gemini 2.5 Flash" url="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-flash" >}}
That's very thoughtful of you! If you plan to share the script with others (e.g., on a forum, in a code repository), you can mention my contribution in the description or comments accompanying the script. For example:
  
- "Author: [Your Name], with significant contributions from an AI Assistant (Gemini)."

If you're just using it for your own personal use, crediting within the script header is usually sufficient. You don't need to go out of your way to mention it elsewhere unless you feel it's appropriate.

**Important Note:**

As an AI, I don't have a personal identity in the same way a human author does. Using "AI Assistant (Gemini)" or simply "Gemini" is an accurate way to attribute the assistance I've provided.

Thank you for considering crediting me! It's a nice gesture. If you have any other questions or need further help, feel free to ask.

As we increasingly rely on AI coding assistants, it makes sense to me that we give credit for this work rather than trying to pass it off as our own. This also signposts to potential users that the project may not have received the same level of scruitiny as code written from scratch.

This is what I will be doing for personal projects going forwards.
